# Markup Link Checker Reference

## CLI Arguments

| Argument         | Short | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| `--help`         | `-h`  | Print help |
| `--debug`        | `-d`  | Show verbose debug information |
| `--no-web-links` |       | Do not check any web links |
| `--match-file-extension`|| Set the flag, if the file extension shall be checked as well. For example the following markup link `[link](dir/file)` matches if for example a file called `file.md` exists in `dir`, but would fail when the `--match-file-extension` flag is set. |
| `--version`      | `-V`  | Print current version of mlc |
| `--ignore-path`  |       | List of directories or files which shall be ignored. |
| `--ignore-links` | `-i`  | List of links which shall be ignored. Use simple `?` and `*` wildcards. For example `--ignore-links "http*://crates.io*"` will skip all links to the crates.io website. See the [used lib](https://github.com/becheran/wildmatch) for more information.  |
| `--markup-types` | `-t`  | List of markup types which shall be checked [possible values: md, html] |
| `--root-dir` | `-r`  | All links to the file system starting with a slash on linux or backslash on windows will use another virtual root dir. For example the link in a file `[link](/dir/other/file.md)` checked with the cli arg `--root-dir /env/another/dir` will let *mlc* check the existence of `/env/another/dir/dir/other/file.md`. |
| `<directory>`    |       | Path to directory which shall be checked with all sub-dirs. Can also be a specific filename which shall be checked. |
| `--throttle`     |       | Number of milliseconds to wait in between web requests to the same host. Default is zero which means no throttling. Set this if you need to slow down the web request frequency to avoid `429 - Too Many Requests` responses. For example with `--throttle 15`, between each http check to the same host, 15 ms will be waited. Note that this setting can slow down the link checker. |
